            I am an explorer of life. A lover of arts, music, fantasy, and adventure. I am a jack of all trades, master
            of
            none, until now hopefully, where I will finally achieve my specialization in web coding. Always a fan of
            video
            games, I started in childhood by reading tales of exploration, later discovering rpg video games where I
            could
            set out on virtual adventures. Now in adulthood, I seek to make my real life an adventure by embracing
            change
            and connecting with new people just as I used to in my games. I love to explore beautiful nature parks and
            trails. I still love art and the beauty of interpretation it brings to the world. I love animals more than
            people and would alternately be
            just
            as happy working in a wildlife sanctuary or doggy day care. However, I pursue technology because of its
            ability
            to connect people and my general love of sci-fi and computers as well. I like web coding because it has a
            nostalgic feel for me even though I never really coded before. However, it takes me back to my elementary
            school
            days. I remember the computer running Windows 3.1 or something similar and if you wanted to play a video
            game,
            you had to exit to DOS to program and setup your game. So when I code, I kinda feel like I'm in DOS again,
            just
            imputting commands to get a website up and running, instead of a game.
